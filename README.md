*DATA DRIVEN TV PROJECT*

##Inspiration
With the advent of livestreaming platforms and the huge marketing potential that video content represents, there is the need of creating new engaging and highly targeted content that is fast to produce. This is where algorithms, data and automation meet with the media industry.

##What it does
If videos were cars, data driven videos would be self-driving cars. We use different processes in order to completely automate the process of producing videos. Those videos, can then be sent to a variety of channels (TV, livestream, online videos..) as well as a variety of platforms (Mobile, smart-tv, ..)

##How we built it
First of all, we engineer a big amount of video "templates" that serve as placeholders for data. In a second step, we automagically assemble all the video templates together to form a unified and live representation of the data. In the example we will showcase, the video is tied to a live tv broadcast.

##Challenges we ran into
Different video formats
Animation and transitioning the videos
Parsing the data from the various API's
Accomplishments that we're proud of
The result looks great and we can't wait to develop it further
What we learned
The project is engaging and this is just the beginning of what can be done.
